# Run instructions

- build project with Gradle
- run main class: simulator.CpuSimulator with 1 argument: instruction filename
- example: simulator.CpuSimulator instructions.txt

## Assumptions

- add instruction files you want to run to 'input' directory
- you can reference just the filename when running project, and it will look for file in 'input' directory
- output of cache values (numbers greater than 0), register A and B values output in log form
